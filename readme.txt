This project involves implementing ray tracing in computer graphic. Ray tracing is a simple 
and powerful algorithm for rendering images. Within the accuracy of the scene and shading 
models and with enough computing time, the images produced by a ray tracer can be physically 
accurate and can appear indistinguishable from real images.

The images under the file 'Framework\data\scenes\ray1' are our test results.
The xml file for cylinder named 'one-cylinder' is also in the file 'Framework\data\scenes\ray1'.
